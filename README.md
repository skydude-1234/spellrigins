This mod is compatibility between [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins) and [Iron's Spells n Spellbooks and](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irons-spells-n-spellbooks) requires the 1.20.1 version of both mods. This mod supports both Forge & Fabric(through connector) versions of Origins, but Fabric is recommended as Origins Forge is discontinued

</div>
There are 3 origins for every single school type, being Blood, Holy, Ender, Evocation, Fire, Ice, Lightning & Nature as well as 2 compatibility origins(Aqua 7 Geo). Exceptions are the Arcane & Eldritch , the Magic Disbeliever(does nothing) and CounterSpell origin.

Origin tiers go from +15% school spell power (novice), to +20% spell school power + an ablility & a weakness(intermediate) to +30% spell school power + 1-2 abilities + fragility & loss of knowledge. 

Loss of knowledge loses 20% spell power in all other schools than of the one that you have chosen. Weakness & Fragility loses magic resistance & spell power in your origin's opposing school



# Compatibility

Skydude's Spell Origins has 2 extra compatablities with [T.O's Magic N Extras](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/to-tweaks-irons-spells) and [GTBC's Geomancy Plus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gtbcs-geomancy-plus), adding the Aqua & Geo class. When these mods are loaded, aqua is weak to lightning but is the weakness of fire, meanwhile geo is weak to ice while it is the weakness of lightning. It is highly recommended to play with these mods installed.


# Abilities
### Each intermediate & specialist can have 1-2 special abilities

</div>

Abilities can range from having a chance to cast a spell or summon creatures to your aid. The chances of an ability being triggered and its duration will scale based off of the respective origin's spell school. While every origin has an ability, some weaker abilities may be supplemented with an extra, more passive ability.
